== Overview

This document has been approved by the SIG membership at its meeting on XXX.  It awaits ratification by the Technical Steering Committee.

== Scope

The scope of the TG is to maintain the specification for psABI,
which includes but is not limited to following items:

1. ELF, DWARF, and other relevant formats.
2. Code model.
3. Calling conventions.

== Goals

The TG's main goal are:

1. Improve and clarify psABI specification.

2. Review and approval for psABI relevant proposals

3. Coordinate with other ABI groups to ensure their specs are consistent with
the psABI specification.

4. Make space for custom extensions to avoid conflicts.

5. Define and explore potential requirements and develop and maintain ABIs or psABI changes for different ABI variantes (e.g. for deeply embedded use-cases with fast-interrupt entry).
